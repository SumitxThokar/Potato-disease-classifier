## Potato Disease Classifier using CNN

This project is a potato disease classifier implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The aim of this project is to create a model that can accurately identify different diseases affecting potato plants based on images of their leaves. By using deep learning techniques, this classifier can help farmers and agronomists quickly identify diseased plants and take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of diseases and minimize crop losses.

### Model Architecture
The classifier utilizes a CNN architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers to downsample the feature maps. This is followed by fully connected layers, which enable the network to learn complex relationships between the extracted features and the disease classes. The final layer employs a softmax activation function to output the predicted probabilities for each disease class.
